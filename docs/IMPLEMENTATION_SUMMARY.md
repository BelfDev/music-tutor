## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Features
- PDF upload and display
- Basic sheet music collection
- Example music sequence generation
- Playback controls with progress
- File management with persistence
- All tests passing (18/18)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Enhancement
- Real PDF-to-music OCR (currently uses example sequences)
- Advanced music notation recognition
- Server-side file management
- Enhanced error recovery
- Performance optimization for large files

### üöß Known Limitations
- Music parsing generates example sequences rather than actual PDF content
- File management simulates server-side operations
- Limited to browser localStorage for persistence
- Basic music notation support

## Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Music Recognition**: Implement actual PDF-to-music OCR

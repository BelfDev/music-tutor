## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 16.0 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** package manager
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **Modern web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd note-pilot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   *This will install all required packages including React, TypeScript, Vite, and audio processing libraries*

3. **Start Development Server**
   
   **Quick Option (using Make):**
   ```bash
   make quick
   ```
   *This automatically installs dependencies if needed and starts the server*
   
   **Manual Option (using npm):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
4. **Open in Browser**
   - Navigate to **http://localhost:3000**
   - The application should load with the Note Pilot interface

### Available Scripts

**Option 1: Using Make (Recommended)**
```bash
# Quick start - installs and starts development server
make quick

# Complete setup with checks
make setup

# Start development server
make dev

# Build for production
make build

# Run all quality checks
make deploy-check

# See all available commands
make help
```

**Option 2: Using npm directly**
```bash
# Development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Run linter with auto-fix
npm run lint:fix
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Start the dev server**: `make dev` or `npm run dev`
2. **Make changes** to the code - hot reload will update the browser automatically
3. **Test features**:
   - Upload a PDF file (try the included `sheet-music/concerning_hobbits.pdf`)
   - Click piano keys to hear audio
   - Enable microphone for pitch detection
   - Explore learning aids and controls
4. **Check code quality**: `make deploy-check` (runs build, lint, and type-check)
5. **Get project status**: `make status` to see system info and project health

### Production Build

To create an optimized production build:

**Using Make (Recommended):**
```bash
# Build and verify everything is ready for deployment
make deploy-check

# Or just build
make build

# Preview the production build
make preview
```

**Using npm directly:**
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Serve the built files locally for testing
npm run preview
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

### Troubleshooting

**If you encounter issues:**

1. **Node.js version**: Ensure you're using Node.js 16+ (`node --version`)
2. **Clear cache**: Delete `node_modules/` and run `npm install` again
3. **Port conflicts**: If port 3000 is busy, Vite will automatically use the next available port
4. **Audio issues**: Some browsers require user interaction before playing audio - click anywhere on the page first
5. **Microphone permissions**: Grant microphone access when prompted for pitch detection features

**Browser-specific notes:**
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full functionality (recommended)
- **Firefox**: Full functionality 
- **Safari**: Some Web Audio limitations, but core features work
- **Mobile browsers**: Touch interface supported, microphone features may vary

## Usage

1. **Upload Sheet Music**: Drag & drop or click to upload a PDF file
2. **Interactive Piano**: Click keys to play notes, toggle letter notation
3. **Playback Controls**: Use play/pause, adjust tempo, set loop points
4. **Microphone**: Enable microphone for real-time feedback as you play
5. **Learning Aids**: Access context-specific tips and pattern recognition

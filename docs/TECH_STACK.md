# Note Pilot Tech Stack

This document outlines the technical decisions and architecture choices for the Note Pilot piano sheet music learning application.

## Frontend Framework

### React 18 with TypeScript
**Choice**: React with TypeScript for type safety and modern development experience
**Reasoning**: 
- Component-based architecture fits well with the modular nature of music learning features
- Large ecosystem and community support
- TypeScript provides compile-time error checking and better IDE support
- Hooks-based development for cleaner state management

### Build Tool: Vite
**Choice**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
**Reasoning**:
- Extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Native ES modules support
- Optimized production builds with Rollup
- Great TypeScript support out of the box

## State Management

### Zustand
**Choice**: Zustand for lightweight, flexible state management
**Reasoning**:
- Much simpler than Redux with less boilerplate
- TypeScript-first design
- Excellent performance with selective subscriptions
- Perfect size for this application's complexity

**Alternative Considered**: Redux Toolkit
- Rejected due to complexity overhead for this application size

## Styling

### Sass (SCSS)
**Choice**: Sass for advanced CSS features
**Reasoning**:
- Variables, mixins, and nesting for maintainable styles
- Better organization with partials
- Responsive design utilities
- Component-scoped styling approach

**Alternative Considered**: Styled Components
- Rejected to keep bundle size smaller and leverage CSS expertise

## Audio Processing

### Tone.js
**Choice**: Tone.js for Web Audio API abstraction
**Reasoning**:
- High-level API for audio synthesis and timing
- Built-in support for musical concepts (notes, scales, timing)
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Active development and community

### PitchFinder
**Choice**: PitchFinder for real-time pitch detection
**Reasoning**:
- Multiple pitch detection algorithms (YIN, AMDF, etc.)
- Optimized for musical applications
- Works well with Web Audio API
- Lightweight and performant

**Alternative Considered**: Custom autocorrelation implementation
- Included as fallback in PitchDetector utility

## PDF Processing

### PDF.js
**Choice**: PDF.js for client-side PDF rendering
**Reasoning**:
- Mozilla-developed, widely used library
- No server-side processing required
- Canvas-based rendering for interactive features
- Supports text extraction for metadata

**Alternative Considered**: Server-side PDF processing
- Rejected to maintain privacy and local-only processing

## UI Icons

### React Icons (Feather Icons)
**Choice**: React Icons with Feather icon set
**Reasoning**:
- Tree-shakeable imports
- Consistent design language
- SVG-based for crisp rendering at any size
- Easy to customize with CSS

## Development Tools

### ESLint + TypeScript ESLint
**Choice**: ESLint with TypeScript rules for code quality
**Reasoning**:
- Catches common errors and enforces consistent style
- TypeScript-specific rules for better type safety
- Integrates well with VS Code and other editors

### Vite Dev Server
**Choice**: Vite's built-in development server
**Reasoning**:
- Hot Module Replacement for instant feedback
- Proxy support for development needs
- HTTPS support for microphone access testing

## Browser APIs Used

### Web Audio API
**Usage**: Real-time audio processing and synthesis
**Fallbacks**: Basic audio playback using HTML5 audio

### MediaDevices API
**Usage**: Microphone access for pitch detection
**Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation without microphone features

### Canvas API
**Usage**: PDF rendering and potential future music notation features
**Fallbacks**: Static image display

### File API
**Usage**: Local PDF file processing
**Fallbacks**: Not applicable (required for core functionality)

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for large dependencies
- **Tree Shaking**: Only import used functions from libraries
- **Asset Optimization**: Compressed images and fonts

### Runtime Performance
- **React Optimizations**: `useCallback`, `useMemo` for expensive operations
- **Audio Processing**: Efficient buffer management and worker threads where possible
- **Memory Management**: Cleanup of audio contexts and event listeners

### Loading Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand
- **Resource Hints**: Preload critical assets
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works, enhancements add value

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Only
**Benefit**: No server-side attack vectors
**Implementation**: All processing in browser sandbox

### Content Security Policy
**Benefit**: Prevent XSS attacks
**Implementation**: Strict CSP headers in production

### Input Validation
**Benefit**: Prevent malicious file uploads
**Implementation**: File type validation and size limits

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation
- Full keyboard support for all interactive elements
- Focus management for modal dialogs
- Skip links for screen readers

### Screen Reader Support
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels and descriptions
- Live regions for dynamic content updates

### Visual Accessibility
- High contrast color scheme
- Scalable fonts and UI elements
- Motion reduction preferences

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Progressive Web App Features
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Offline capability for core features

### Performance on Mobile
- Optimized bundle size
- Efficient audio processing
- Battery usage considerations

## Future Scalability

### Architecture Decisions for Growth
- **Component Architecture**: Modular design for feature additions
- **State Management**: Scalable patterns for complex state
- **API Design**: Extensible interfaces for new features

### Potential Enhancements
- **MIDI Support**: Integration with MIDI devices
- **Cloud Sync**: Optional cloud storage for user data
- **Collaborative Features**: Multi-user practice sessions

**Reasoning**:
- No server required
- Global CDN distribution
- Automatic HTTPS
- Cost-effective scaling

### Production Build
- **Minification**: JavaScript and CSS optimization
- **Compression**: Gzip/Brotli compression
